## Installation on a Server
There are a few steps you need to follow to install this on your Webserver. 
<ul>
    <li>Rename the .env.example to .env</li>
    <li>Fill out your Information on the .env file. Including Database</li>
    <li>Open a cmd and go to the Project Location</li>
    <li>Run the Command "php artisan migrate:fresh". This will create all the tables on you DB</li>
</ul>

After that is done you should be able to start up your Webserver and let it run.
